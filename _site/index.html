<p> </p>

<p>Building autonomous artificial agents able to grow open-ended repertoires of skills across their lives is one 
of the fundamental goals of AI. To that end, a promising developmental approach recommends the design of
intrinsically motivated agents that learn new skills by generating and pursuing their own 
goals–<i>autotelic agents</i>. However, despite recent progress, existing algorithms still show serious
limitations in terms of goal diversity, exploration, generalization or skill composition.</p>

<p>Inspired by the seminal work of the developmentalist Vygotsky, we suggest the design of
<i>Vygotskian autotelic agents</i> (VAA) able to interact with others and, more importantly, 
able to internalize these interactions within the agent to transform them into
<i> cognitive tools</i> supporting the development of new cognitive functions. 
Indeed, most of our skills could not be learned in isolation. Formal education teaches us to reason 
systematically, books teach us history, and YouTube might teach us how to cook. Most importantly, 
our values, traditions, norms and most of our goals are cultural in essence. 
This knowledge, and some argue, some of our highest cognitive functions such as abstraction,
compositional imagination or relational thinking, are formed through linguistic and cultural interactions 
with others.</p>

<p>Therefore, Vygotskian autotelic  agents should be immersed into <i>rich socio-cultural worlds</i>, 
an immensely important attribute of our environment that is mostly omitted in modern AI, including deep 
reinforcement learning research. We focus on language especially, and how its structure and content may 
support the development of new cognitive functions in artificial agents, just like it does in humans.

<p>On this webpage, we provide a <a href="/papers">list of papers</a> connected to VAAI. A shorter list detailing implementations of trully Vygotskian Autotelic agents as well as potential 
techniques that could help develop them is given <a href="/vygo_agents">here</a>.</p>
