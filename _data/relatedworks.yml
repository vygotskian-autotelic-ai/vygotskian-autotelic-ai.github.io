  abstract: "Under frequency fitness assignment (FFA), the fitness corresponding to an objective value is its encounter frequency in fitness assignment steps and is subject to minimization. FFA renders optimization processes invariant under bijective transformations of the objective function value. On TwoMax, Jump, and Trap functions of dimension s, the classical (1+1)-EA with standard mutation at rate 1/s can have expected runtimes exponential in s. In our experiments, a (1+1)-FEA, the same algorithm but using FFA, exhibits mean runtimes that seem to scale as sÂ² ln s. Since Jump and Trap are bijective transformations of OneMax, it behaves identical on all three. On OneMax, LeadingOnes, and Plateau problems, it seems to be slower than the (1+1)-EA by a factor linear in s. The (1+1)-FEA performs much better than the (1+1)-EA on W-Model and MaxSat instances. We further verify the bijection invariance by applying the Md5 checksum computation as transformation to some of the above problems and yield the same behaviors. Finally, we show that FFA can improve the performance of a memetic algorithm for job shop scheduling."

  abstract: "The performance of evolutionary algorithms can be heavily undermined when constraints limit the feasible areas of the search space. For instance, while covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) is one of the most efficient algorithms for unconstrained optimization problems, it cannot be readily applied to constrained ones. Here, we used concepts from memetic computing, i.e., the harmonious combination of multiple units of algorithmic information, and viability evolution, an alternative abstraction of artificial evolution, to devise a novel approach for solving optimization problems with inequality constraints. Viability evolution emphasizes the elimination of solutions that do not satisfy viability criteria, which are defined as boundaries on objectives and constraints. These boundaries are adapted during the search to drive a population of local search units, based on CMA-ES, toward feasible regions. These units can be recombined by means of differential evolution operators. Of crucial importance for the performance of our method, an adaptive scheduler toggles between exploitation and exploration by selecting to advance one of the local search units and/or recombine them. The proposed algorithm can outperform several state-of-the-art methods on a diverse set of benchmark and engineering problems, both for quality of solutions and computational resources needed."
