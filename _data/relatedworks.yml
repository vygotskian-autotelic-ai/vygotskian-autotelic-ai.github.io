  abstract: "Under frequency fitness assignment (FFA), the fitness corresponding to an objective value is its encounter frequency in fitness assignment steps and is subject to minimization. FFA renders optimization processes invariant under bijective transformations of the objective function value. On TwoMax, Jump, and Trap functions of dimension s, the classical (1+1)-EA with standard mutation at rate 1/s can have expected runtimes exponential in s. In our experiments, a (1+1)-FEA, the same algorithm but using FFA, exhibits mean runtimes that seem to scale as sÂ² ln s. Since Jump and Trap are bijective transformations of OneMax, it behaves identical on all three. On OneMax, LeadingOnes, and Plateau problems, it seems to be slower than the (1+1)-EA by a factor linear in s. The (1+1)-FEA performs much better than the (1+1)-EA on W-Model and MaxSat instances. We further verify the bijection invariance by applying the Md5 checksum computation as transformation to some of the above problems and yield the same behaviors. Finally, we show that FFA can improve the performance of a memetic algorithm for job shop scheduling."

  abstract: "The performance of evolutionary algorithms can be heavily undermined when constraints limit the feasible areas of the search space. For instance, while covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) is one of the most efficient algorithms for unconstrained optimization problems, it cannot be readily applied to constrained ones. Here, we used concepts from memetic computing, i.e., the harmonious combination of multiple units of algorithmic information, and viability evolution, an alternative abstraction of artificial evolution, to devise a novel approach for solving optimization problems with inequality constraints. Viability evolution emphasizes the elimination of solutions that do not satisfy viability criteria, which are defined as boundaries on objectives and constraints. These boundaries are adapted during the search to drive a population of local search units, based on CMA-ES, toward feasible regions. These units can be recombined by means of differential evolution operators. Of crucial importance for the performance of our method, an adaptive scheduler toggles between exploitation and exploration by selecting to advance one of the local search units and/or recombine them. The proposed algorithm can outperform several state-of-the-art methods on a diverse set of benchmark and engineering problems, both for quality of solutions and computational resources needed."

  abstract: "While reinforcement learning algorithms can learn effective policies for complex tasks, these policies are often brittle to even minor task variations, especially when variations are not explicitly provided during training. One natural approach to this problem is to train agents with manually specified variation in the training task or environment. However, this may be infeasible in practical situations, either because making perturbations is not possible, or because it is unclear how to choose suitable perturbation strategies without sacrificing performance. The key insight of this work is that learning diverse behaviors for accomplishing a task can directly lead to behavior that generalizes to varying environments, without needing to perform explicit perturbations during training. By identifying multiple solutions for the task in a single environment during training, our approach can generalize to new situations by abandoning solutions that are no longer effective and adopting those that are. We theoretically characterize a robustness set of environments that arises from our algorithm and empirically find that our diversity-driven approach can extrapolate to various changes in the environment and task."

  abstract: "Multiobjective optimization in general aims at learning aboutthe problem at hand.  Usually the focus lies on objectivespace properties such as the front shape and the distributionof optimal solutions. However, structural characteristics inthe decision space can also provide valuable insights. In cer-tain applications, it may even be more important to find astructurally diverse set of close-to-optimal solutions than toidentify a set of optimal but structurally similar solutions.Accordingly, multiobjective optimizers are required that arecapable of considering both the objective space quality ofa Pareto-set approximation and its diversity in the decisionspace.Although NSGA, one of the first multiobjective evolution-ary algorithms, explicitly considered decision space diversity,only a few other studies address that issue. It therefore isan open research question how modern multiobjective evolu-tionary algorithms can be adapted to search for structurallydiverse high-quality Pareto-set approximations. To this endwe propose an approach to integrate decision space diversityinto hypervolume-based multiobjective search. We presenta modified hypervolume indicator and integrate it into anevolutionary algorithm. The proof-of-principle results showthe potential of the approach and indicate further researchdirections for structure-oriented multiobjective search."

  abstract: "Typically, optimization attempts to find a solution which minimizes the given objective function. But often, it might also be useful to obtain a set of structurally very diverse solutions which all have acceptable objective values. With such a set, a decision maker would be given a choice of solutions to select from. In addition, he can learn about the optimization problem at hand by inspecting the diverse close-to-optimal solutions.This paper proposesNOAH, an evolutionary algorithm which solves a mixed multi-objective problem: Determine a maximally diverse set of solutions whose objective values are below a provided objective barrier. It does so by iteratively switching between objective value and set-diversity optimization while automatically adapting a constraint on the objective value until it reaches the barrier. Tests on an nk-Landscapes problem and a 3-Sat problem as well as on a more realistic bridge construction problem show that the algorithm is able to produce high quality solutions with a significantly higher structural diversity than standard evolutionary algorithms."

This allows for the auto- matic synthesis of rich variations in style for simulated jumps, flips, and walks. While well-posed motion optimization problems result in a single optimal motion, we explore using underconstrained motion descriptions and then optimizing for diversity. As input, the method takes a parameterized controller for a successful motion instance, a set of constraints that should be preserved, and a pairwise distance metric between motions. An offline optimization then produces a highly diverse set of motion styles for the same task. We demonstrate results for a variety of 2D and 3D physics-based motions and show that this approach can generate compelling new motions."

  abstract: "Understanding the behaviour of heuristic search methods is a challenge. This even holds for simple local search methods such as 2-OPT for the Traveling Salesperson problem. In this paper, we present a general framework that is able to construct a diverse set of instances that are hard or easy for a given search heuristic. Such a diverse set is obtained by using an evolutionary algorithm for constructing hard or easy instances that are diverse with respect to different features of the underlying problem. Examining the constructed instance sets, we show that many combinations of two or three features give a good classification of the TSP instances in terms of whether they are hard to be solved by 2-OPT."

  abstract: "Computing diverse sets of high-quality solutions has gained increasing attention among the evolutionary computation community in recent years. It allows practitioners to choose from a set of high-quality alternatives. In this paper, we employ a population diversity measure, called the high-order entropy measure, in an evolutionary algorithm to compute a diverse set of high-quality solutions for the Traveling Salesperson Problem. In contrast to previous studies, our approach allows diversifying segments of tours containing several edges based on the entropy measure. We examine the resulting evolutionary diversity optimisation approach precisely in terms of the final set of solutions and theoretical properties. Experimental results show significant improvements compared to a recently proposed edge-based diversity optimisation approach when working with a large population of solutions or long segments. "

  category: "Evolutionary Diversity Optimization"
  abstract: "In practise, it is often desirable to provide the decision-maker with a rich set of diverse solutions of decent quality instead of just a single solution. In this paper we study evolutionary diversity optimization for the knapsack problem (KP). Our goal is to evolve a population of solutions that all have a profit of at least (1âÎµ)âOPT, where OPT is the value of an optimal solution. Furthermore, they should differ in structure with respect to an entropy-based diversity measure. To this end we propose a simple (Î¼+1)-EA with initial approximate solutions calculated by a well-known FPTAS for the KP. We investigate the effect of different standard mutation operators and introduce biased mutation and crossover which puts strong probability on flipping bits of low and/or high frequency within the population. An experimental study on different instances and settings shows that the proposed mutation operators in most cases perform slightly inferior in the long term, but show strong benefits if the number of function evaluations is severely limited."

  abstract: "In the area of evolutionary computation the calculation of diverse sets of high-quality solutions to a given optimization problem has gained momentum in recent years under the term evolutionary diversity optimization. Theoretical insights into the working principles of baseline evolutionary algorithms for diversity optimization are still rare. In this paper we study the well-known Minimum Spanning Tree problem (MST) in the context of diversity optimization where population diversity is measured by the sum of pairwise edge overlaps. Theoretical results provide insights into the fitness landscape of the MST diversity optimization problem pointing out that even for a population of Î¼=2 fitness plateaus (of constant length) can be reached, but nevertheless diverse sets can be calculated in polynomial time. We supplement our theoretical results with a series of experiments for the unconstrained and constraint case where all solutions need to fulfill a minimal quality threshold. Our results show that a simple (Î¼+1)-EA can effectively compute a diversified population of spanning trees of high quality."

We contribute to this line of research by studying evolutionary diversity optimization for two of the most prominent permutation problems, namely the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) and Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP). We explore the worst-case performance of a simple mutation-only evolutionary algorithm with different mutation operators, using an established diversity measure. Theoretical results show most mutation operators for both problems ensure production of maximally diverse populations of sufficiently small size within cubic expected run-time.

  category: "Evolutionary Diversity Optimization"
  abstract: "When a problem instance is perturbed by a small modification, one would hope to find a good solution for the new instance by building on a known good solution for the previous one. Via a rigorous mathematical analysis, we show that evolutionary algorithms, despite usually being robust problem solvers, can have unexpected difficulties to solve such re-optimization problems. When started with a random Hamming neighbor of the optimum, the (1+1) evolutionary algorithm takes Î©(n2) time to optimize the LeadingOnes benchmark function, which is the same asymptotic optimization time when started in a randomly chosen solution. There is hence no significant advantage from re-optimizing a structurally good solution. We then propose a way to overcome such difficulties. As our mathematical analysis reveals, the reason for this undesired behavior is that during the optimization structurally good solutions can easily be replaced by structurally worse solutions of equal or better fitness. We propose a simple diversity mechanism that prevents this behavior, thereby reducing the re-optimization time for LeadingOnes to O(Î³Î´n), where Î³ is the population size used by the diversity mechanism and Î´â¤Î³ the Hamming distance of the new optimum from the previous solution. We show similarly fast re-optimization times for the optimization of linear functions with changing constraints and for the minimum spanning tree problem."

  abstract: "Diversity plays a crucial role in evolutionary computation. While diversity has been mainly used to prevent the population of an evolutionary algorithm from premature convergence, the use of evolutionary algorithms to obtain a diverse set of solutions has gained increasing attention in recent years. Diversity optimization in terms of features on the underlying problem allows to obtain a better understanding of possible solutions to the problem at hand and can be used for algorithm selection when dealing with combinatorial optimization problems such as the Traveling Salesperson Problem. We explore the use of the star-discrepancy measure to guide the diversity optimization process of an evolutionary algorithm.
In our experimental investigations, we consider our discrepancy-based diversity optimization approaches for evolving diverse sets of images as well as instances of the Traveling Salesperson problem where a local search is not able to find near optimal solutions. Our experimental investigations comparing three diversity optimization approaches show that a discrepancy-based diversity optimization approach using a tie-breaking rule based on weighted differences to surrounding feature points provides the best results in terms of the star discrepancy measure."

  abstract: "Diversity mechanisms are key to the working behaviour ofevolutionary multi-objective algorithms. With this paper, wecontribute to the theoretical understanding of such mecha-nisms by means of rigorous runtime analysis.  We considerthe OneMinMax problem for which it has been shown in [11]that a standard benchmark algorithm called(Î¼+1)-SIBEA isnot able to obtain a population with optimal hypervolumedistribution  in  expected  polynomial  time  if  the  populationsize is relatively small. We investigate the same setting as in[11] and show that(Î¼+ 1)-SIBEA is able to achieve a goodapproximation of the optimal hypervolume distribution veryefficiently.  Furthermore, we study OneMinMax in the con-text of search-based diversity optimization and examine thetime until(Î¼+1)-SIBEA with a search-based diversity mech-anism has obtained a population of maximal diversity cover-ing the whole Pareto front."

  abstract: "Finding different solutions to the same problem is a key aspect of intelligence associated with creativity and adaptation to novel situations. In reinforcement learning, a set of diverse policies can be useful for exploration, transfer, hierarchy, and robustness. We propose Diverse Successive Policies, a method for discovering policies that are diverse in the space of Successor Features, while assuring that they are near optimal. We formalize the problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) where the goal is to find policies that maximize diversity, characterized by an intrinsic diversity reward, while remaining near-optimal with respect to the extrinsic reward of the MDP. We also analyze how recently proposed robustness and discrimination rewards perform and find that they are sensitive to the initialization of the procedure and may converge to sub-optimal solutions. To alleviate this, we propose new explicit diversity rewards that aim to minimize the correlation between the Successor Features of the policies in the set. We compare the different diversity mechanisms in the DeepMind Control Suite and find that the type of explicit diversity we are proposing is important to discover distinct behavior, like for example different locomotion patterns."

  abstract: "Efficient exploration remains a challenging research problem in reinforcement learning, especially when an environment contains large state spaces, deceptive local optima, or sparse rewards. To tackle this problem, we present a diversity-driven approach for exploration, which can be easily combined with both off- and on-policy reinforcement learning algorithms. We show that by simply adding a distance measure to the loss function, the proposed methodology significantly enhances an agent's exploratory behaviors, and thus preventing the policy from being trapped in local optima. We further propose an adaptive scaling method for stabilizing the learning process. Our experimental results in Atari 2600 show that our method outperforms baseline approaches in several tasks in terms of mean scores and exploration efficiency."

  abstract: "Standard reinforcement learning methods aim to master one way of solving a task whereas there may exist multiple near-optimal policies. Being able to identify this collection of near-optimal policies can allow a domain expert to efficiently explore the space of reasonable solutions. Unfortunately, existing approaches that quantify uncertainty over policies are not ultimately relevant to finding policies with qualitatively distinct behaviors. In this work, we formalize the difference between policies as a difference between the distribution of trajectories induced by each policy, which encourages diversity with respect to both state visitation and action choices. We derive a gradient-based optimization technique that can be combined with existing policy gradient methods to now identify diverse collections of well-performing policies. We demonstrate our approach on benchmarks and a healthcare task. "

  abstract: "Exploration is a key problem in reinforcement learning, since agents can only learn from data they acquire in the environment. With that in mind, maintaining a population of agents is an attractive method, as it allows data be collected with a diverse set of behaviors. This behavioral diversity is often boosted via multi-objective loss functions. However, those approaches typically leverage mean field updates based on pairwise distances, which makes them susceptible to cycling behaviors and increased redundancy. In addition, explicitly boosting diversity often has a detrimental impact on optimizing already fruitful behaviors for rewards. As such, the reward-diversity trade off typically relies on heuristics. Finally, such methods require behavioral representations, often handcrafted and domain specific. In this paper, we introduce an approach to optimize all members of a population simultaneously. Rather than using pairwise distance, we measure the volume of the entire population in a behavioral manifold, defined by task-agnostic behavioral embeddings. In addition, our algorithm Diversity via Determinants (DvD), adapts the degree of diversity during training using online learning techniques. We introduce both evolutionary and gradient-based instantiations of DvD and show they effectively improve exploration without reducing performance when better exploration is not required."

  abstract: "Quality-Diversity (QD) is a concept from Neuroevolution with some intriguing applications to Reinforcement Learning. It facilitates learning a population of agents where each member is optimized to simultaneously accumulate high task-returns and exhibit behavioral diversity compared to other members. In this paper, we build on a recent kernel-based method for training a QD policy ensemble with Stein variational gradient descent. With kernels based on f-divergence between the stationary distributions of policies, we convert the problem to that of efficient estimation of the ratio of these stationary distributions. We then study various distribution ratio estimators used previously for off-policy evaluation and imitation and re-purpose them to compute the gradients for policies in an ensemble such that the resultant population is diverse and of high-quality."

  year: 2020
  category: "Maximum Entropy"
  abstract: "Conventional Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms usually have one single agent learning to solve the task independently. As a result, the agent can only explore a limited part of the state-action space while the learned behavior is highly correlated to the agent's previous experience, making the training prone to a local minimum. In this work, we empower RL with the capability of teamwork and propose a novel non-local policy optimization framework called Diversity-regularized Collaborative Exploration (DiCE). DiCE utilizes a group of heterogeneous agents to explore the environment simultaneously and share the collected experiences. A regularization mechanism is further designed to maintain the diversity of the team and modulate the exploration. We implement the framework in both on-policy and off-policy settings and the experimental results show that DiCE can achieve substantial improvement over the baselines in the MuJoCo locomotion tasks."

  year: 2019
  category: "Maximum Entropy"
  abstract: "In this work, we present a reinforcement learning algorithm that can find a variety of policies (novel policies) for a task that is given by a task reward function. Our method does this by creating a second reward function that recognizes previously seen state sequences and rewards those by novelty, which is measured using autoencoders that have been trained on state sequences from previously discovered policies. We present a two-objective update technique for policy gradient algorithms in which each update of the policy is a compromise between improving the task reward and improving the novelty reward. Using this method, we end up with a collection of policies that solves a given task as well as carrying out action sequences that are distinct from one another. We demonstrate this method on maze navigation tasks, a reaching task for a simulated robot arm, and a locomotion task for a hopper. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on deceptive tasks in which policy gradient methods often get stuck."
