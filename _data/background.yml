- abstract: "3rd ed. This book is for anyone who has ever wondered how a child develops\
    \ language, thought, and knowledge. Before this classic appeared, little was known\
    \ of the way children think. In 1923, however, Jean Piaget, the most important\
    \ developmental psychologist of the twentieth century, took the psychological\
    \ world by storm with The Language and Thought of the Child. Applying for the\
    \ first time the insights of social psychology and psychoanalysis to the observation\
    \ of children, he uncovered the ways in which a child actively constructs his\
    \ or her understanding of the world through language. The book has since been\
    \ a source of inspiration and guidance to generations of parents and teachers.\
    \ While its conclusions remain contentious to this very day, few can deny the\
    \ huge debt we owe to this pioneering work in our continuing attempts to understand\
    \ the minds of the child \u2013 publisher's description. The functions of language\

- abstract: "This book combines two worlds\u2014children and science\u2014in an entirely\
    \ unique way that yields exciting discoveries about both. The authors show that\
    \ by the time children are three, they've solved problems that stumped Socrates\
    \ with an agility computers still cannot match. This book explains just how, and\
    \ how much, babies and young children know and learn, and how much parents naturally\
    \ teach them. The book argues that evolution designed us to both teach and learn.\
    \ Nurture is our nature, and the drive to learn is our most important instinct.\
    \ The new science of children also reveals insights about adult capacities. The\
    \ authors argue that even very young children\u2014as well as adults\u2014use\
    \ some of the same methods that allow scientists to learn so much about the world. "

- abstract: In this groundbreaking book, Tomasello presents a comprehensive usage-based
    theory of language acquisition. Drawing together a vast body of empirical research
    in cognitive science, linguistics, and developmental psychology, Tomasello demonstrates
    that we don't need a self-contained "language instinct" to explain how children
    learn language. Their linguistic ability is interwoven with other cognitive abilities.

- abstract: Many current theories of human cognition stress its biological roots,
    while others stress its cultural roots. Tomasello demonstrates that both of these
    perspectives are essential in creating a unified account of the evolution, history,
    and development of human cognition. He makes a powerful case that while human
    cognition is biologically based, this biological adaptation's key contribution
    is that it permits the flowering of the cultural-historical and ontogenetic processes
    that have actually made the varieties of human cognition what they are today.

- abstract: Since it was introduced to the English-speaking world in 1962, Lev Vygotsky's
    highly original exploration of human mental development has become recognized
    as a classic foundational work of cognitive science. Vygotsky analyzes the relationship
    between words and consciousness, arguing that speech is social in its origins
    and that only as children develop does it become internalized verbal thought.

- abstract: "There is an overwhelming archeological and genetic evidence that modern\
    \ speech apparatus was acquired by hominins by 600,000 years ago1. On the other\
    \ hand, artifacts signifying modern imagination, such as (1) composite figurative\
    \ arts, (2) bone needles with an eye, (3) construction of dwellings, and (4) elaborate\
    \ burials arose not earlier than 70,000 years ago2. It remains unclear (1) why\
    \ there was a long gap between acquisition of modern speech apparatus and modern\
    \ imagination, (2) what triggered the acquisition of modern imagination 70,000\
    \ years ago, and (3) what role language might have played in this process. Our\
    \ research into evolutionary origin of modern imagination has been driven by the\
    \ observation of a temporal limit for the development of a particular component\
    \ of imagination. Modern children not exposed to recursive language in early childhood\
    \ never acquire the type of active constructive imagination called Prefrontal\
    \ Synthesis (PFS). Unlike vocabulary and grammar acquisition, which can be learned\
    \ throughout one\u2019s lifetime, there is a strong critical period for the development\
    \ of PFS and individuals not exposed to recursive language in early childhood\
    \ can never acquire PFS as adults. Their language will always lack understanding\
    \ of spatial prepositions and recursion that depend on the PFS ability. In a similar\
    \ manner, early hominins would not have been able to learn recursive language\
    \ as adults and, therefore, would not be able to teach recursive language to their\
    \ children. Thus, the existence of a strong critical period for PFS acquisition\
    \ creates an evolutionary barrier for behavioral modernity. An evolutionary mathematical\
    \ model suggests that a synergistic confluence of three events (1) a genetic mutation\
    \ that extended the critical period by slowing down the prefrontal cortex development\
    \ simultaneously in two or more children, (2) invention of recursive elements\
    \ of language, such as spatial prepositions, by these children and (3) their dialogic\
    \ communications using these recursive elements, resulted in concurrent conversion\
    \ of a non-recursive communication system of their parents to recursive language\
    \ and acquisition of PFS around 70,000 years ago."

- abstract: "If you could become the shadow of a 2- to 8-year-old, furtively tagging\
    \ along as the child goes about his or her daily activities, you would notice\
    \ a curious form of language behavior\u2014remarks in which the child seems to\
    \ talk to himself or herself or to no one in particular. This speech-to-self occurs\
    \ frequently. It can surface in virtually any of the child\u2019s pursuits\u2014\
    during fantasy play, drawing and painting, building with blocks, tackling academic\
    \ tasks, idly passing the time of day, and quieting down before naptime or nightly\
    \ sleep. Researchers call this spontaneous, self-directed talk private speech.\
    \ Unlike adults, who self-consciously talk to themselves only in solitary moments,\
    \ young children freely use private speech in public. So at ease are preschool\
    \ and primary-school children in speaking to themselves in front of others that\
    \ on observing this behavior, many adults question its normalcy! \u201CConfused,\u201D\
    \ \u201Ctouched,\u201D and \u201Cstrange\u201D are among the descriptors I have\
    \ heard them apply to self-talking children, generalizing from \u201Ccrazy people,\u201D\
    \ who not only speak aloud to fantasized audiences but also act improperly in\
    \ a great many ways because they are indifferent to their social surroundings.\
    \ To be sure, talking to oneself in the midst of a roomful of people is not acceptable\
    \ in the adult social world. Yet all of us engage in private speech from time\
    \ to time. And it is ubiquitous in early childhood. When children between the\
    \ ages of 3 and 10 are observed in classrooms, private speech makes up as much\
    \ as 20 percent to 60 percent of their language. Why do young children engage\
    \ in it so frequently? To grasp the significance of private speech in the life\
    \ of the child, let\u2019s begin by looking at it in ourselves. When are you most\
    \ likely to talk out loud to yourself? In response to this question, most adults\
    \ say they engage in audible self-talk when they face cognitive, emotional, or\
    \ social challenges. Here are some self-reports: \u2022 \u201CAt the end of a\

    \ with innuendo, language is fundamentally a tool for conveying meaning \u2014\
    \ a uniquely human magic trick in which you vibrate your vocal cords to make your\

    \ behind this magic? How does meaning work?In Louder than Words, cognitive scientist\
    \ Benjamin Bergen draws together a decade\u2019s worth of research in psychology,\
    \ linguistics, and neuroscience to offer a new theory of how our minds make meaning.\
    \ When we hear words and sentences, Bergen contends, we engage the parts of our\
    \ brain that we use for perception and action, repurposing these evolutionarily\
    \ older networks to create simulations in our minds. These embodied simulations,\
    \ as they\u2019re called, are what makes it possible for us to become better baseball\
    \ players by merely visualizing a well-executed swing; what allows us to remember\
    \ which cupboard the diapers are in without looking, and what makes it so hard\
    \ to talk on a cell phone while we\u2019re driving on the highway. Meaning is\
    \ more than just knowing definitions of words, as others have previously argued.\
    \ In understanding language, our brains engage in a creative process of constructing\
    \ rich mental worlds in which we see, hear, feel, and act.Through whimsical examples\
    \ and ingenious experiments, Bergen leads us on a virtual tour of the new science\
    \ of embodied cognition. A brilliant account of our human capacity to understand\

- abstract: Using words to label categories is a true human universal. In addition
    to their public function in communication, labels may also serve private functions
    in shaping how concepts are represented. The present work explored the effects
    of assigning category labels on perceptual representations. A connectionist simulation
    is presented that examines the effects of labels on learning different types of
    categories. It is found that labels can augment perceptual information, and play
    an especially important role in shaping representations of entities whose perceptual
    features alone are insufficient for reliable classification.

- abstract: Human cognitive abilities are remarkable. We easily go beyond what is
    perceptually available to reason about abstract systems. Our cognitive ability
    to adapt to a vast range of environments, and even to alter our environment to
    suit our desires, has given our species so great an advantage over other mammals
    that we are now poised to exterminate most of our former predators, and must use
    our ingenuity to preserve a few. Indeed, for many theorists, the sophistication

- abstract: 'Embodied agents use bodily actions and environmental interventions to
    make the world a better place to think in. Where does language fit into this emerging
    picture of the embodied, ecologically efficient agent? One useful way to approach
    this question is to consider language itself as a cognition-enhancing animal-built
    structure. To take this perspective is to view language as a kind of self-constructed
    cognitive niche: a persisting but never stationary material scaffolding whose
    crucial role in promoting thought and reason remains surprisingly poorly understood.
    It is the very materiality of this linguistic scaffolding, I suggest, that gives
    it some key benefits. By materializing thought in words, we create structures
    that are themselves proper objects of perception, manipulation, and (further)
    thought. '

- abstract: "This paper explores a variety of different versions of the thesis that\
    \ natural language is involved in human thinking. It distinguishes amongst strong\
    \ and weak forms of this thesis, dismissing some as implausibly strong and others\
    \ as uninterestingly weak. Strong forms dismissed include the view that language\
    \ is conceptually necessary for thought (endorsed by many philosophers) and the\
    \ view that language is de facto the medium of all human conceptual thinking (endorsed\
    \ by many philosophers and social scientists). Weak forms include the view that\
    \ language is necessary for the acquisition of many human concepts and the view\
    \ that language can serve to scaffold human thought processes. The paper also\
    \ discusses the thesis that language may be the medium of conscious propositional\
    \ thinking, but argues that this cannot be its most fundamental cognitive role.\
    \ The idea is then proposed that natural language is the medium for nondomain-specific\
    \ thinking, serving to integrate the outputs of a variety of domain-specific conceptual\
    \ faculties (or central-cognitive \u201Cquasimodules\u201D). Recent experimental\

  title: "From Embodied to Socially Embedded Agents \u2013 Implications for Interaction-Aware\
    \ Robots"
  year: 2002
- abstract: This paper proposes a research direction to study the development of 'artificial
    social intelligence' of autonomous robots which should result in 'individualized
    robot societies'. The approach is highly inspired by the 'social intelligence
    hypothesis', derived from the investigation of primate societies, suggesting that
    primate intelligence originally evolved to solve social problems and was only
    later extended to problems outside the social domain. We suggest that it might
    be a general principle in the evolution of intelligence, applicable to both natural
    and artificial systems. Arguments are presented why the investigation of social
    intelligence for artifacts is not only an interesting research issue for the study
    of biological principles, but may be a necessary prerequisite for those scenarios
    in which autonomous robots are integrated into human societies, interacting and
    communicating both with humans and with each other. As a starting point to study
    experimentally the development of robots' 'social relationships', the investigation
    of collection and use of body images by means of imitation is proposed. A specific
    experimental setup which we use to test the theoretical considerations is described.
    The paper outlines in what kind of applications and for what kind of robot group
    structures social intelligence might be advantageous.

- abstract: 'The paper discusses two prominent theories of cognitive development and
    relates them to experiments in social robotics. The main difference between these
    theories lies in the different views on the relationship between a child and its
    social environment: a) the child as a solitary thinker (Piaget) and b) the child
    in society (Vygotsky). We discuss the implications this has on the design of socially
    intelligent agents, focusing on robotic agents. We argue that the framework proposed
    by Vygotsky provides a promising research direction in autonomous agents. We give
    examples of implementations in the area of social robotics which support our theoretical
    considerations. More specifically, we demonstrate how a teacher-learner setup
    can be used to teach a robot a proto-language. The same control architecture is
    also used for a humanoid doll robot which can interact with a human by imitation.
    Another experiment addresses dynamic coupling of movements between a human and
    a mobile robot. Here, emergent robot-human interaction dynamics are influenced
    by the temporal coordination between the robot''s and the human''s movements.'

  title: Studying Robot Social Cognition Within a Developmental Psychology Framework
  year: 1999
- abstract: "This article addresses a classical question: Can a machine use language\
    \ meaningfully and if so, how can this be achieved? The first part of the paper\
    \ is mainly philosophical. Since meaning implies intentionality on the part of\
    \ the language user, artificial systems which obviously lack intentionality will\
    \ be `meaningless' (pace e.g. Dennett). There is, however, no good reason to assume\
    \ that intentionality is an exclusively biological property (pace e.g. Searle)\
    \ and thus a robot with bodily structures, interaction patterns and development\
    \ similar to those of human beings would constitute a system possibly capable\
    \ of meaning \u2013 a conjecture supported through a Wittgenstein-inspired thought\
    \ experiment. The second part of the paper focuses on the empirical and constructive\
    \ questions. Departing from the principle of epigenesis stating that during every\
    \ state of development new structure arises on the basis of existing structure\
    \ plus various sorts of interaction, a model of human cognitive and linguistic\
    \ development is proposed according to which physical, social and linguistic interactions\
    \ between the individual and the environment have their respective peaks in three\
    \ consecutive stages of development: episodic, mimetic and symbolic. The transitions\
    \ between these stages are qualitative, and bear a similarity to the stages in\

- abstract: "The concept of \u201Csocial situatedness,\u201D that is, the idea that\
    \ the development of individual intelligence requires a social (and cultural)\
    \ embedding, has recently received much attention in cognitive science and artificial\
    \ intelligence research, in particular work on social or epigenetic robotics.\
    \ The work of Lev Vygotsky, who put forward this view as early as the 1920s, has\
    \ influenced the discussion to some degree but still remains far from well known.\
    \ This article therefore is aimed at giving an overview of his cognitive development\
    \ theory and a discussion of its relation to more recent work in primatology and\
    \ socially situated artificial intelligence, in particular humanoid robotics."

- abstract: "The standard view of classical cognitive science stated that cognition\
    \ consists in the manipulation of language-like structures according to formal\
    \ rules. Since cognition is \u2018linguistic\u2019 in itself, according to this\
    \ view language is just a complex communication system and does not in\uFB02uence\
    \ cognitive processes in any substantial way. This view has been criticized from\
    \ several perspectives and a new framework (Embodied Cognition) has emerged that\
    \ considers cognitive processes as non-symbolic and heavily dependent on the dynamical\
    \ interactions between the cognitive system and its environment. But notwithstanding\
    \ the successes of the embodied cognitive science in explaining low-level cognitive\
    \ behaviors, it is still not clear whether and how it can scale up for explaining\
    \ high-level cognition. In this paper we argue that this can be done by considering\
    \ the role of language as a cognitive tool: i.e. how language transforms basic\
    \ cognitive functions in the highlevel functions that are characteristic of human\
    \ cognition. In order to do that, we review some computational models that substantiate\
    \ this view with respect to categorization and memory. Since these models are\
    \ based on a very rudimentary form of non-syntactic \u2018language\u2019 we argue\
    \ that the use of language as a cognitive tool might have been an early discovery\
    \ in hominid evolution, and might have played a substantial role in the evolution\
    \ of language itself."

- abstract: 'This article surveys reinforcement learning approaches in social robotics.
    Reinforcement learning is a framework for decision-making problems in which an
    agent interacts through trial-and-error with its environment to discover an optimal
    behavior. Since interaction is a key component in both reinforcement learning
    and social robotics, it can be a well-suited approach for real-world interactions
    with physically embodied social robots. The scope of the paper is focused particularly
    on studies that include social physical robots and real-world human-robot interactions
    with users. We present a thorough analysis of reinforcement learning approaches
    in social robotics. In addition to a survey, we categorize existent reinforcement
    learning approaches based on the used method and the design of the reward mechanisms.
    Moreover, since communication capability is a prominent feature of social robots,
    we discuss and group the papers based on the communication medium used for reward
    formulation. Considering the importance of designing the reward function, we also
    provide a categorization of the papers based on the nature of the reward. This
    categorization includes three major themes: interactive reinforcement learning,
    intrinsically motivated methods, and task performance-driven methods. The benefits
    and challenges of reinforcement learning in social robotics, evaluation methods
    of the papers regarding whether or not they use subjective and algorithmic measures,
    a discussion in the view of real-world reinforcement learning challenges and proposed
    solutions, the points that remain to be explored, including the approaches that
    have thus far received less attention is also given in the paper. Thus, this paper
    aims to become a starting point for researchers interested in using and applying
    reinforcement learning methods in this particular research field. '

- abstract: Creativity is an important evolutionary adaptation that allows humans
    to think original thoughts, to find solutions to problems that have never been
    encountered before, and to fundamentally change the way we live. Recently, one
    important area of creativity, namely verbal creativity, has attracted considerable
    interest from constructionist approaches to language. The present issue builds
    on this emerging field of study and adds an interdisciplinary perspective to it
    by also presenting the view from cognitive literary studies as well as psychology.
    First, however, this introduction surveys the recent issues arising in constructionist
    studies of verbal creativity.

- abstract: 'Recent research has documented specific linkages between language and
    conceptual organization in the developing child. However, most of the evidence
    for these linkages derives from children who have made significant linguistic
    and conceptual advances. We therefore focus on the emergence of one particular
    linkage--the noun-category linkage--in infants at the early stages of lexical
    acquisition. We propose that when infants embark upon the process of lexical acquisition,
    they are initially biased to interpret a word applied to an object as referring
    to that object and to other members of its kind. We further propose that this
    initial expectation will become increasingly specific over development, as infants
    begin to distinguish among the grammatical categories as they are marked in their
    native language and assign them more specific types of meaning. To test this hypothesis,
    we conducted three experiments using a modified novelty-preference paradigm to
    reveal whether and how novel words influence object categorization in 12- to 13-month
    old infants. The data reveal that a linkage between words and object categories
    emerges early enough to serve as a guide in infants'' efforts to map words to
    meanings. Both nouns and adjectives focused infants'' attention on object categories,
    particularly at the superordinate level. Further, infants'' progress in early
    word learning was associated with their appreciation of this linkage between words
    and object categories. These results are interpreted within a developmental and
    cross-linguistic account of the emergence of linkages between linguistic and conceptual
    organization. '

- abstract: "Verb learning seems especially difficult for children learning many languages,\
    \ at least relative to nouns. Many have speculated because this is because verbs\
    \ refer to relational events that are components of much more complex events.\
    \ Consider a buying-selling event. If the child hears the verb \u201Cbuy\u201D\
    , does it mean sell, get, handover, give money, or perhaps smile? By this view,\
    \ a key problem in learning verb is parsing complex events into relevant components\
    \ and then attending to the right components. This study presents evidence that\
    \ parents use sound symbolism to direct children\u2019s attention to the proper\
    \ component and that children readily use that information when learning new verbs.\
    \ The study specifically compares two languages that differ in their sound-symbolic\
    \ words\u2014Japanese language with its class of mimetics that are heavily used\
    \ in speech to children and English language which is commonly considered to be\
    \ a less sound symbolic language. The results indicate that both Japanese- and\
    \ English-speaking parents use sound symbolism to teach verbs and that both children\
    \ learning Japanese- and English benefit from this symbolism. This work provides\
    \ new insight into verb learning, the nature of the input, and the universal aspects\
    \ of sound symbolism in language use."

- abstract: Humans are unique in their range of environments and in the nature and
    diversity of their behavioral adaptations. While a variety of local genetic adaptations
    exist within our species, it seems certain that the same basic genetic endowment
    produces arctic foraging, tropical horticulture, and desert pastoralism, a constellation
    that represents a greater range of subsistence behavior than the rest of the Primate
    Order combined. The behavioral adaptations that explain the immense success of
    our species are cultural in the sense that they are transmitted among individuals
    by social learning and have accumulated over generations. Understanding how and
    when such culturally evolved adaptations arise requires understanding of both
    the evolution of the psychological mechanisms that underlie human social learning
    and the evolutionary (population) dynamics of cultural systems.
